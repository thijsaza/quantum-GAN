# Quantum Generative Adversarial Networks (Quantum GAN)

In this project as part of QIST4320, we explore Quantum GANs. 

## Objectives and tasks:
### Learn and understand what a (quantum) generative adverserial network is.
- How does a generative adverserial network (GAN) work? What are the roles of the “generator” and the “discriminator”? How do we train a GAN?
- How does a quantum GAN work? How do we train a it?
- Why can a QGAN outperform its classical counterpart? What are the challenges?
  
## Provide an implementation of a quantum GAN
- Implement a Quantum Circuit Born Machine (QCBM) to take the role of the “generator” in the QGAN.
- Extend the QCBM to a QGAN by using a “discriminator” to train it. Beware that training a QGAN is challenging.

### Perform benchmarking experiments of your QGAN.
